## Programming Process

### Overarching Themes

For all of the following programs you will need the following modules:

- machine
- time
- utime
- struct
- binascii - to convert strings into hexadecimal

### Setting up Thonny

Firstly you will need to download the Thonny IDE at https://thonny.org/, in order to be able to write code for the Raspberry Pi Pico to execute. Once you have succesfully downloaded and installed Thonny, plug your Raspberry Pi Pico into the computer - whilst holding the BOOTSEL button - and press the Stop/Restart button at the top of the Thonny window; a window should pop up allowing you to install MicroPython firmware to the Raspberry Pi Pico. Make sure the target device is correct and press install, once the installation is finished you are ready to write your code.

### LED Process

#### Components Required:

- Raspberry Pi Pico with USB Connection to PC
- Breadboard
- LED
- Analogue Joystick
- 220 ohm Resistor
- 5 M-M Cables
- 5 F-M Cables

To begin with you could start with a very basic circuit containing the Raspberry Pi Pico, LED, and 220 ohm resistor all plugged into the breadboard. You should then write the code to blink the LED on and off. Following this you can develop both the circuit and code further by adding in a button, which is then used as a condition in a selection statement with the code to toggle the LED nested in it. Further advancements are made by implemeting the ability for the LED to change its brightness, via the use of pulse-width modulation (PWM). Finally you could replace the button with an analogue joystick and use this to change the brightness of the LED based upon the X value of the joystick after an analogue to digital converter (ADC) had been applied to it.

### Light Dependant Resistor (LDR)/Photo-Resistor Process

#### Components Required

- Raspberry Pi Pico with USB Connection to PC
- Breadboard
- Light Dependant Resistor (LDR) / Photo-Resistor
- 10 kiloohm Resistor
- 2 M-M Cables
- 4 F-M Cables

Moving onto using sensors, you could start with an LDR measuring the surrounding light levels. You need to apply an analogue to digital converter (ADC) to the readings from the LDR and convert this value into a percentage, for easier handling. Then use a while loop to constantly check the value of the LDR, and use an if statement to check if it goes below 20%. If this condition is met you could output the data using a print statement. The uses of a program such as this could be automating lights turning on or off if a certain light level is reached; this may help save energy because it would prevent lights being left on when they are not needed.

### Ultrasonic Sensor Process

#### Components Required

- Raspberry Pi Pico with USB Connection to PC
- Breadboard
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- 4 M-M cables
- 8 F-M Cables

Having used the LDR you may wish to move onto using an ultrasonic sensor, in a similar fashion to how you used the LDR. You need to create an algorithm to convert the time taken, for the sound to be emitted from the sensor and reflect back off of an object, into a distance - in centimeters - by using the speed of sound in air and this time in the equation: 
$$ distance = speed * time $$
Using this algorithm you are able to check whether an object is closer to the sensor than a set distance, for example 15cm, and output the value if the condition is met. Uses of this system involve: water level detection and detecting if people are too close to historic artifacts.

### Temperature Sensor Process

#### Components Required

- Raspberry Pi Pico with USB Connection to PC
- Breadboard
- Temperature Sensor
- 6 Jumper Cables
- 4 F-M Cables

Another sensor you may wish to use could be a temperature sensor, to use this with the Raspberry Pi Pico you need to use the analogue output of the sensor. With this value you can calculate the reference voltage, by using the: input voltage (3.3V)(Vi), and the analogue output (AO) in the formula
$$ Vr = Vi * (AO / 65523) $$ 
With the reference voltage, series resistance (44900)(Rs), and input voltage (Vi) you can find the resistance of the thermistor (Rt), using the formula
$$ Rt = 1 / (((Vi / Vr) - 1) * (1 / Rs)) $$ 
You can then use this resistance (Rt) value in the Steinhart equation, to give the temperature in Â°C
$$ (1 / ((log(Rt / 10000)) + (1 / (25 + 273.15))) - 273.12 $$

### Particulate Matter Sensor Process

#### Components Required

- Raspberry Pi Pico with USB Connection to PC
- Breadboard
- Particulate Matter Sensor (PMS5003) and Breakout Board
- 8 F-M Cables

Using the knowledge you have acquired from all of the previous sensors and programs you will be able to connect a particulate matter sensor (PMS) to the Raspberry Pi Pico and constantly monitor the surrounding air and read this data every minute. You will have to install two modules, being: pms5003-micropython and micropython-uasyncio, the implementation of these modules allow you to read the data from the PMS and then use the values throughout your program. This has uses within many settings, such as offices, classrooms, and homes because it allows users to see if the air surrounding them is safe which means health risks are minimised.

### Gas Sensor Process

#### Components Required
- The Things Uno with USB Connection to PC
- Grove Multichannel Gas Sensor
- 4 pin grove to male jumper cable

Using the Arduino IDE you wil need to download the 'Grove - Multichannel Gas Sensor' library, by going into tools > manage libraries and searching for the name. With the module installed you can get the code to read the sensor value by going into the file tab, clicking on examples then the installed library and then ReadSensorValue_Grove. When you have this code and the Arduino plugged in press the upload button on the top bar of the IDE and then the open serial button in the top right corner. You should now see the values from the sesnor being outputted, you will notice there are more than just NO2 however the others can be deleted if you will not be using them. To be implement the ability to transmit data you need to install another library, TheThingsNetwork, and find the SendOTAA example code. With this code and the NO2 sensor code, you can join the two programs together and use the NO2 value from the sensor to create a payload to be transmitted to The Things Netwok.

### LoRa Transmission, via the RAK module.

#### Setting up the RAK Module

Connect the RAK Module to the Raspberry Pi Pico and write the code to be able to connect to The Things Network. Join this code and the code used for the sensors together, to be able to transmit the sensor readings to The Things Network. Once you have done this you can move on to setting up The Things Network for use. You can create strings to act as payloads in the format: Sensor Type, Sensor Name, Value 1, Value 2, and Value 3, using the values from the sensor and hardcoding the sensor type and name in the program. However the fields Value 2 and Value 3 were only required for the particulate matter sensor, so can be put as 0 in the other programs. Then convert the string payload into hexadecimal so that it can be transmitted

#### Use of The Things Network

You need to create an account with The Things Network, click on your profile and select console then join or create an application to which you can transmit data and create your device in this application. You also need to code your own payload formatter in JavaScript so that the data can be converted into a more readable format, for human users. To find your DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey, to enter into the programs, you must go into the 'End devices' section of your application; then you need to click on your device and under the 'Activation information' subheading you should see the DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey. After this you can then test your programs involving the RAK module, checking for a connection to The Things Network and then the transmission of data. Finally create a webhook to Datacake, so that the data can be uplinked and stored in Datacake, to do this go into the 'Integrations' section and click on 'Webhooks'. Once in the webhooks section click 'Add webhook' and select the Datacake template; give the webhhok a name and use the API token from Datacake, found in the API section of the 'Edit Profile' setting. After creating the webhook, you need to go to Datacake and copy the link, found in the LoRaWAN Setup Instructions, into the Uplink message box in the webhook settings.

#### Use of Datacake

You will have to create an account with Datacake. In your account you will need to create a device, by pressing the 'Add Device' Button and selecting the LoRaWAN option then select 'New Product' and give the product a name; select The Things Stack V3 as the Network Server, after this enter the devices DevEUI and name. Finally select the free plan and add the device. Then in the configuration you will have to create another, similar, payload formatter on Datacake and finally create fields for your data to be stored in. On Datacake you can create a dashboard, so that you can display your data.
